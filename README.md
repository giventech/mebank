# mebank


# How to Run

This is a step-by-step guide how to run the example:

## Installation

* The example is implemented in Java 8. See    https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml. 
  The  examples need to be compiled so you need to install a JDK (Java Development Kit). A JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is not
  sufficient. After the installation you should be able to execute   `java` and `javac` on the command line.
  It also need maven install to be able to run the build phase
   
## Build

Change to the directory `mebank` and run `mvn clean install` 

## Run Exercise 1 
------------------
    java -cp target/me-bank-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar mebank.Main
